# fs-lab — System Overview

## 🎯 Project Goal

fs-lab is a multi-service system designed to benchmark and analyze cold and warm start behavior across different backend runtimes (Node.js, Python, Go) hosted on the same platform.

The project focuses on measuring real-world latency, platform-induced variance, and startup characteristics under identical conditions. All measurements are collected automatically, stored centrally, and analyzed asynchronously.

The goal is not to compare languages in isolation, but to understand how runtime, platform, and deployment characteristics interact in practice.
